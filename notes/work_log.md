# Work Log Procedure:

- Use this page to describe the nitty gritty of what has been done towards a project on a specific date.  

- Always use the date for each entry and tag your initials (YYYY-MM-DD AF).  

- Always put a new entry at the top of the page so you can see the newest work first.  

- If anything important occurs, note it in the 'Project Updates' in a more concise way than you would in this log.  

- Do not delete entries, this is meant to serve as a rudimentary version control and archive.  

- Leave the Procedure at the top of the page.
