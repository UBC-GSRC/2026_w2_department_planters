The goal of this project is to make the planters outside of the Geography building usable for the GSA again. Rather than scrap all of the wood and rebuild from scratch, we will do our best to salvage what still has life. The winter is a slow time for the planters so make sure that this work is done before March so the GSA can get good use from them.
